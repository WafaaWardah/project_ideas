Here is a list of project ideas offered by [Wafaa Wardah](https://www.tu.berlin/index.php?id=34807), mainly for developing further as Masters or Bachelors theses at the [QU Lab](https://www.tu.berlin/en/qu), TU Berlin. These can also be turned into student group projects for courses offered by the QU Lab. If you are interested in any of these topics listed here or want to discuss an idea of your own, send me an email ([wafaa.wardah@tu-berlin.de](mailto:wafaa.wardah@tu-berlin.de)).
